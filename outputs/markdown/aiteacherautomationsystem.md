## Synthesized Knowledge

**Core Thesis:**
The speaker, GKCS, shares how they built an AI teacher using vector databases and chat GPT to provide immediate responses to user queries, eliminating the need for human teaching assistants and ensuring high-quality responses.

**Key Insights:**

* Vector databases can answer queries like "given an object, find all similar objects" by representing each object as a point in n-dimensional space.
* Using a vector database with a large language model (like chat GPT) enables Retrieval-Augmented Generation (R-A-G), where context is retrieved from the database and used to augment the query before generating a response.
* The speaker uses Neon, a vector database service, which provides features like hierarchical NSW algorithm for clustering vectors and versioning history with walkable interface.
* Vector databases can significantly reduce the number of comparisons needed between objects, making them efficient for large datasets.

**Actionable Takeaways:**

* To build an AI teacher using vector databases and chat GPT, start by converting your video lessons and PDFs into text using a transcription service like AWS Transcribe.
* Use a vector database service like Neon to store the transcribed text and enable similarity searches.
* Integrate the vector database with a large language model (like chat GPT) to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (R-A-G).
* Consider using services like OpenAI's file upload API to upload transcription files for later use in conversational AI.
* When implementing a vector database, focus on creating a connection string and using the DB's ease of use features, such as table management and SQL integration.
