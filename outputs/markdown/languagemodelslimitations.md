**Core Thesis**

The core thesis is that large language models struggle to provide direct answers to mathematical and geometrical questions, instead often providing ambiguous or vague responses due to their training methodology on input tokens and predicting output tokens. To overcome this limitation, the model needs to be trained in a way that incorporates more context specific to math and geometry.

**Key Insights**

* Large language models are primarily designed to predict output tokens based on input tokens, rather than providing direct answers to questions.
* The model's response is determined by calculating probabilities of subsequent tokens, which can lead to ambiguous or vague responses, especially in mathematical and geometrical contexts.
* Despite grammatically correct and reasonable-sounding responses, the model may not be able to provide a clear answer to a question, such as "how many sides does a square have?"
* The model's inability to distinguish between direct answers (e.g. 4) and ambiguous responses (e.g. "it depends on your definition of square") is due to its design and training methodology.

**Actionable Takeaways**

* To improve the model's performance in mathematical and geometrical contexts, it needs to be trained with more context-specific input data.
* One possible solution is to incorporate additional math-related context into the model through techniques such as data augmentation or curriculum learning.
* The model can benefit from being explicitly trained on mathematical and geometrical questions, rather than relying solely on its ability to predict output tokens based on input tokens.
* By incorporating more context-specific knowledge, the model can learn to provide direct answers to mathematical and geometrical questions, rather than ambiguous responses.
