## Synthesized Knowledge

**Core Thesis**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has tremendous potential to revolutionize the way large-language models interact with external systems, enabling them to take actions and perform tasks, rather than just providing text-based outputs. This protocol has the potential to significantly reduce human work and automate mundane tasks.

**Key Insights**

* MCP enables a two-party system where clients (large-language models) can send requests to servers (typical servers exposing APIs) to perform actions.
* The unique aspect of MCP is that large-language models can take decisions based on the current situation, unlike traditional if-else conditions.
* Three major use cases for MCP are:
	+ Search Engine Optimization (SEO): aggregating results and providing a consolidated response to improve search rankings.
	+ Retrieval Augmented Generation: using external data sources to answer queries in real-time, rather than relying on model updates.
	+ Applications: integrating with aggregator websites to provide faster and better-structured responses to user queries.

**Actionable Takeaways**

* Consider implementing MCP servers in your applications to enable large-language models to interact with external systems and perform actions.
* Identify opportunities for using MCP in search engine optimization (SEO) to improve search rankings and visibility.
* Explore the potential of retrieval augmented generation to provide faster and better-structured responses to user queries.
* Be prepared for the possibility that large companies like Google or OpenAI may adopt MCP, leading to a shift in how large-language models interact with external systems.
