## Synthesized Knowledge

**Core Thesis**

The current state of AI engineering, particularly in the area of large language models, is limited by its inability to solve complex problems, lack of internal concept of time and space, and inability to learn continuously. The speaker suggests that a shift towards new architectures, such as diffusion-based models, and the development of system 2 thinking, self-defined goals, and governance are necessary for true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to be achieved.

**Key Insights**

* Large language models have limitations in predicting complex outcomes and understanding consequences of actions, making them unsuitable for tasks that require human-like intelligence.
* The current trend of improvement in large language models is plateauing, with diminishing returns on investment, suggesting the need for new architectures and approaches.
* System 2 thinking, self-defined goals, and governance are essential components of AGI that are still in their infancy and require significant research breakthroughs to achieve.
* Continuous learning and the ability to compartmentalize knowledge are key aspects of human intelligence that current AI models struggle to replicate.

**Actionable Takeaways**

* Invest in researching new architectures, such as diffusion-based models, that can overcome the limitations of large language models.
* Prioritize the development of system 2 thinking, self-defined goals, and governance in AI systems to achieve true AGI.
* Encourage interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to address the challenges and complexities involved in developing AGI.
* Recognize that achieving AGI is a long-term goal that may take decades, rather than years, and requires patience, persistence, and significant investment in research and development.
