  "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, we'll begin now. Gentlemen at the table, I think you know, but I'll identify them anyway for the record. Dr. George Lowe, Acting Administrator of NASA, Dr. Robert Gilruth, Director of the Man Spacecraft Center, Dale Myers, Associate Administrator, Man Space Flight, Rocco Patron, Apollo Program Manager. Dr. Lowe will have a few opening remarks and then we'll go right into questions and this will be followed immediately by a second press conference when the operational people come over. Dr. Lowe? Those parachutes we saw an hour and 45 minutes ago were the most beautiful sight I've seen since last April and they marked the successful end of Apollo 14 which was America's 24th manned space flight, our sixth flight to the moon and the third to have landed on the moon. And 10 years ago, man had not yet flown in space. Ten years ago, Alan Shepherd was preparing for America's first manned flight which was a 15 minute hop that carried him to an altitude of 116 miles and 300 miles downrange. Today Alan Shepherd, Stutt, Rusa and Ed Mitchell have returned from a journey that carried them one quarter of a million miles into space, a journey to the moon, a journey of exploration of the unknown. On this flight, this Apollo 14, we saw men in space examining and pronouncing good a vital piece of flight hardware. We saw men on the ground, team with men in space, to react to an exceedingly complex problem with the abort program and to solve the problem so that they could continue with the flight. And we saw and heard two highly skilled explorers seeking the top of cone crater, collecting samples, setting up experiments and taking photographs, compiling the most complete exploration of one small part of the moon yet. On that first Mercury flight in 1961, Alan Shepherd tested man's reaction to the space environment. In Apollo 14, just 10 years later, Alan Shepherd and his crew demonstrated that man belongs in space, that man can achieve objectives well beyond the capabilities of any machine that has yet been devised. Alan Shepherd and his crew in Apollo 14 have shown us what man can do and given us a vision of what man will do in the future. Ready to answer any questions you might have about the flight. Wait for the microphone. Art. Dr. Lowe, when you add up all the pluses and minuses, what kind of a score are you putting down on your score card for this flight? It seems to me that we used to add up test objectives when we started in the Apollo program and with Apollo 7 and 8, we always added up to something between 96 and 105%. I can only give this an absolutely perfect score. The flight achieved all of the objectives that we set out to achieve. I think it will be many months before we really know how much we brought back on the samples that they collected, the data that we will see from the ALSAAP. I think more than that we saw man really for the first time demonstrate how much can be done on one short flight in terms of experimentation that was well prepared in advance, well planned and exceedingly well carried out. Next. Mark. I guess this is for Rocco Patron. I was just wondering whether any of the problems we saw in this flight, whether it strikes you that they might make it tight to get Apollo 15 off in July? I believe we understand the problems that we encountered and I do not believe they will affect Apollo 15 in terms of the schedule but we do look at these things. We will have to look at them hard. For one reason we brought the probe back. We will have to look at the data and it will be a number of weeks yet before we will know we have nothing serious facing us. But based on what we saw, I do not see anything now that will hold up 15 but we will have to review the data as we usually do before we commit for the next flight. Rocco, is this the first time on Apollo flight that we have lost the eggs? To my recollection that is the first time we have lost a guidance system in flight. Yes, it was the board guidance you are referring to. I am sorry about that. Dr. Lowe, in view of the success of this mission, do you think that you will go fully forward with the rest of Apollo and go through 17 or is there still a danger of one of them being cut? We plan to go fully forward with the rest of Apollo 14 including 17. I would like to ask Dr. Lowe if he thinks the success of this flight will make his task easier in Congress this year or do you think mines are pretty well made up there on both sides of the argument as to whether we should continue the manned spaceflight program? As I told you during the budget press briefing a week ago, I think we have got an extremely good space program for Fiscal Year 1972. It is a very tight one but it has a very good content. I expect to get this fully approved in the Congress. Certainly a success like the one we have just had will help. Mary again? Dr. Gilruth, you were present in helping in the selection of Shepard and on the first flight and I wondered if you can tell us your reactions today compared to the first flight and also what you think in retrospect of Shepard's performance then compared to this flight? Yes, Al is in a very unusual position of having made our first spaceflight as an American. Then still being young enough and very able so that he was able to command a flight to the moon. I was in a very unusual position in as much as I selected Al among to be one of the original seven astronauts. I also selected Al to be the first man to fly, a Mercury capsule. Our procedures were a lot more simple in those days because I was the sole source so to speak. In fact, Mr. Glennon, our administrator said he just didn't want to know. He didn't want to be in the act. He said that is entirely up to you Bob. I was very proud of Al's performance in Freedom 7. I think all America was. I was very sorry to see him develop that in nearer disease, ear problem. It's only a year and a half or so that I talked to him when he felt he was cured and said he wanted to go back on flight status. Well, I feel very happy and proud today to have been part of his returning to flight status and becoming a commander of one of this very successful follow flight. I guess I think he couldn't have done much better on either flight to marry. I'm very proud of him. Mark? I guess as for Dale Myers, I'm not trying to take anything away from the technical brilliance of the NASA industry contractor team as you people call it. But we had a very serious problem in Apollo 13 in the command and service module. We had another potentially mission affecting problem in the command and service module in the probe and drug this time. And four, three or four or five potentially very serious problems in the lunar module this time. It strikes me that only some real fast work got us down to the moon. Do you think some tightening up needs to be done in the Apollo project? We talked about that as these problems developed during the flight. And as we look back at the history of the program, I think you'll find as we look at problems that we had probably less problems on this flight than we've had previously. Certainly that probe problem could have been a mission problem. We had some workarounds that we hadn't used yet when we actually got to the point of trying the probe again. We did have ways to continue the mission if we had difficulty with it undocking. I think as far as that equipment is concerned, we've got to look at it and understand what actually happened on that particular probe problem. I think the problem associated with the abort switch is one that is not an indication of any loosening of capability because it looks like it was one of these zero-G problems. One of these things that occur with either a piece of the switch or an element of that switch that only showed up in zero-G. It's a thing that we always face, we always work against, and I see nothing different in this flight than in previous flights as far as the potential of that kind of thing happening and as far as the disciplines in the system doing everything we can to keep them from happening. Let's go with Jay. Over here. Jay Bob. Dr. Lowe, following up on the problems questions here. I can't help but think with the morale problem that you've been faced with at the Cape and throughout the industry with all the cutbacks, if this couldn't be part of it, and at the Cape itself, with the morale problem there, is there anything on the horizon in the future that could be given to these people such as a possibility of shuttle coming there or anything that could raise the morale at the Cape without going through this two months or so as you did this time of pep talks and films and tapes to get everybody's morale back up? First, let me say that I don't believe that there was a morale problem among any of the people working on Apollo 14. I visited the Cape several times myself. I talked to Alan, his crew, I talked to Dr. Debus, I talked to some people working on the program, and I think everybody involved on Apollo 14 was dedicated to making that the perfect hardware, the most perfect piece of hardware that could be made. As Dale has already said, the problems were, I don't think any more severe than we've had on previous flights, and I believe that when you have a piece of hardware as complex as the Apollo spacecraft, and as far in advance of the everyday life kind of things in terms of state of the art, you will always have a number of problems. We've had them on Apollo 7 and 8 and 9 and 10 and 11 and 12 and 13 as well as in this flight. But at the same time, you must recognize that the Apollo design is a forgiving one. Apollo is designed to allow man to work around this kind of problem, and with the exception of Apollo 13, where we had a very serious explosion, a serious accident, we have been able to work around any problem that we've had and successfully complete the missions. So the first part of your question, I don't think that morale or lack of attention had anything to do with the things you saw in this flight. As far as the second part of the question is concerned, we are looking very hard as to where future programs, particularly the Space Shuttle, will be tested, launched, flown, landed, and so on. In taking these looks, we are making every effort to use existing facilities when they can be utilized. So there is a very high probability that the cape will be used in shuttle activities. But until we've completed our studies with industry, we cannot commit to this now. Zack Strickland. Dale, from the onset, this mission has been fraught with problems, both minor and major. That continued right on through recovery when one of the parachutes failed to be untangled. We talked about all the other problems. Will you tell us a little bit about the parachute problem and could it have caused any kind of problem at all? First, I'd like to say that was the most beautiful shot of parachute drogs and reef parachutes that I've ever seen. They're really getting expert at taking pictures of those things as they come in. And I'll join George in saying that's the most beautiful picture I've seen since Apollo 13. It appears that the chutes are disconnected as they should and one parachute fell over the capsule. I don't know any more than that about it. It does look like they were able to handle the problem. They've practiced that kind of a problem previously and it looks like they were able to handle it without any difficulty. One more over here first. Dr. Lowe, just to follow up there a little bit. At the end of Apollo 17, you will be formally, in a sense, giving the moon to Russia in their exploration. There are no future programs. What is NASA's top thinking at this moment about continuing with lunar explorations? Do you have any plans in the back of your mind or where do we go after 17? With Apollo 17, we will, as you say, finish the first phase of manned lunar exploration. We have studies underway. We have no firm plans as yet for major exploration of the moon in the 1980s. You won't see any more in this decade after Apollo 17. Bill? For George Lowe, in 1965, President Johnson enunciated a promotion policy, which if I read it correctly, Rusa and Mitchell will get promotions. Question is, will they? And also, how will this promotion policy affect Shepard, if at all? Bill, as I recall the policy, it said that each man to fly in space will get one promotion up to and including the rank of captain and the navy or colonel in the Air Force. And so far, we have not, as a result of a space flight, promoted anybody beyond the captain colonel rank. We have not yet discussed the application of the policy to this flight. But I assume that we will carry it out as we had in the past, which means that Rusa and Mitchell will get promotions, and Shepard will. Just follow that up. Is there any doubt at all in your mind that it will be followed? You say you haven't applied it, and you suppose that it will. Is there any reason to suppose that it won't? There's no reason to suppose that it won't. Well, that's up to captain and colonel. Wallace Shiraz is in a similar situation with Shepard, I guess. And so was Jim Lovell, I believe. For quite a while now, and this is to Mr. Low, the figure $24 billion has been quoted as what the Apollo program has cost. Not least in Europe, this figure has been thrown around. But it seems to me that $24 billion has been the figure for quite a while. Can you say what is the total cost of Apollo up till today of the landing of Apollo 14? I think I'd pass to Ruko on that. I think that estimate is very close to the appropriations we have had today. It was less than $21 billion at the time of Apollo 11. So $24 by now is probably a reasonable number. I'm sure we can get you that afterwards. I believe the $24 might be our program runout cost, but we could get that number exactly. It's in that vicinity for the runout of the Apollo program. Dr. Low, could you tell us, please, what was the biggest problem that you found in the speech between NASA and the Space Authority of USSR for collaboration in space activity? What was the biggest problem that you found in the speech between NASA and the Space Authority of USSR? You're referring to the discussions I held in Moscow two weeks ago? We had no big problems. We had an excellent meeting between the President and the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union myself and reached a very general agreement in many areas of space exploration. And we look forward to working with the Soviets in all of these areas. Okay, just a couple back here. Dr. Low, can you be more specific in general things that you're going to do in regard to Soviet Union now and space? Yes, if we should take the time in this Apollo press conference. I'd be glad to do it at any time, but in fact, I've already done so in Washington a week ago. I think since we're here to talk about Apollo 14, I'd have to see afterwards. We get a lot of background material on it. I'd like to keep it on Apollo 14 if we can. Mark Bloom has got his third question. It's a follow to my second. In your comment, Mr. Myers, earlier about the abort switch problem, you indicated it was you struck me, you sort of just excused it away.it is something that could occur in zero G. Well, of course, isn't that something you're looking for on the ground because we do have to go into zero G? And also, if this was a piece of solder from a toggle switch, isn't this the same problem that goes back to five, six, seven years ago when you people were accepting two and three toggle switches out of ten from that New England contractor? Zero G problems always with us. We have done everything we know how to do in the development and in the production of switches, in the inspection of switches. We go through thermal testing, vibration testing, shake testing to try to determine whether or not there are problems within those switches. And we don't know anything more to do in how to work with these switches in zero G. Hans. And we have had those problems before, but and we continue to work every way we can to eliminate those problems. I guess I ought to ask Dr. Goode. I would like to know what's the current thinking on quarantine. Will this be the last one? We certainly hope this will be the last one. Certainly the people here, our own members of the team and those that have worked with this feel that this will probably be the last one. We have, as you know, found no evidence of any living organisms whatsoever in both Apollo 11 and 12. And we learned from the Russians that they had also found nothing in their Luna 16 from Dr. Venogradov. I am conscious of the fact that I'm sitting alongside the acting administrator here who's going to have to make the decision to hope I can influence them because I really think that we've reached the point where the quarantine is no longer necessary indeed if it ever was. With that bit of lobbying, I think we'll conclude this press conference and get on to the next one. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, Ed. How'd you get here? Good. It's another good one. Good. Is Dr. Berry here? Well, I presume Dr. Berry will be in the first seat here left, so I'll start with him. Dr. Charles Berry, director of medical research and operations, manned spacecraft center. Mr. Donald K. Slayton, director of flight crew operations. Colonel James McDivitt, Apollo spacecraft program manager. Pete Frank, who was lead flight director, Apollo 14. Dr. Barry, you're on the ground. I'm going to go ahead and get the floor. I'm going to go ahead and get the floor. I'm going to go ahead and get the floor. I'm going to go ahead and get the floor. Dr. Frank, who was lead flight director, Apollo 14. Mr. Sigurd Schilberg, director of flight operations. Captain Chet Lee, who was Apollo mission director. Osrell Covington, who is director of manned flight support, guided space flight center. Major General David Jones, commander eastern flight test range and DOD manager of manned space flight support operations. Gentlemen, do you have a statement or would you like to go right to questions? Go right to questions. I'd like to start near the end of the flight. Watching on television, there appeared to be some smoke came out of the top of the space capsule just before it came into the clouds. I think just before round-drobe deploy or perhaps a main chute, I'm not sure. Could you tell us whether that was something from the spacecraft, any standard operation or something that has not happened before? On each flight, we try to dump the fuel and oxidizer that are in the command module RCS systems so that we don't have them onboard the spacecraft when we hit the water. They're highly toxic and this is something that we do on every flight so that it wasn't anything new. Pete, how did the probe withstand the splash? Did you have any trouble? It didn't come loose or anything? Well, I can only assume that it didn't come loose. It was certainly strapped down in the air. I don't see how it could possibly have come loose and we don't really know the crew didn't say anything about it, but I'm sure it didn't. For Dr. Berry, how are they? Well, you probably know as much as I do right at this moment because we haven't had any contact with the people inside the MQF. They've been very busy at the moment, but certainly from everything that we could see and all of their reports, they're in fine shape and they certainly appear to be, and I would expect that report to be the same when we hear from them inside the MQF. When you landed on the moon, you were supposedly just a few yards from where you, the spot you aimed at. How far were you from the cross, the mental cross in the water today? Miss distance was less than a mile from the target. Art Snyder. I understand some of the engineers believe that the radar was actually working fine, that the time of coming on the line was dictated by the nature of the terrain. Is there anything to that? I'm not sure that we can draw that conclusion right now. It may have been strobing in a short range rather than a long range, but we're still looking at that date and we're not really going to have it sorted out for another few days. We'll handle it like any other potential anomaly in the flight and we'll have a good, thorough investigation of it before we conclude it either was or wasn't good. I can't tell you right now, but it looked like from the bits that we saw that it was probably strobing in a short range, zero to three thousand feet. Mark Bloom. I'll ask either Chet Lee how much less than a mile or Pete Frank what did the IMU say as to where they were off target? You have that, Chet? I'm sorry, I didn't get those numbers. I left before we got them. Mark, I remember a figure or something, you know, the target for I think it's drogue deploy and was something like seven tenths of a mile off from that. And that was the IMU number. Tell me what happened with the parachute at the end that caused it to snarl around the capsule? Well, I think what happened was just the lack of wind that we had there failed to blow that shoot away from the spacecraft. The pyros fired apparently and at least the swimmers reported that and that the shoot had come loose, but it just draped down over the spacecraft instead of being blown away. I would like to have an estimate or a guesstimate about the distance between Splashpoint and the recovery ship.Well, it was it was greater than a mile. Of course, the ship did not try to sit right on that one point. It's certainly less than five miles. The ship was about five, supposed to be about five miles away. So if the target point was within about seven tenths, you can draw your own conclusions, something like that. Elsofter. I assume as a layman that flying to the moon is still a pretty dangerous business, but I also assume that it's getting a lot safer now that you have three successful flights behind you. And I was wondering if any of you would be able to quantify, to use one of your words, just how safer it is. Is there a marked increase in safety as a result of these three successes? I think your first statement is right. Going to the moon is a dangerous thing. And I think that as we go along, we keep adding things to the spacecraft, but it's going to continue to be a dangerous thing to do. It's going to continue to be a very complicated thing to do. I was here at the previous press conference when you were talking about the tremendous number of problems we had. It really didn't seem to me that way. I guess it's all in your viewpoint. I thought we had a pretty successful mission, although it was sort of stated that it probably wasn't. It seems to me that with the large number of pieces of equipment that have to work, we're going to continue to have things happen to it. Unfortunately, the people working in the program are human, and the pieces of equipment we use are only as good as we humans can possibly make them. While it's going to be dangerous, we're going to try to make it as safe as we, the humans, certainly can. And each flight that starts off as a new flight doesn't know what's happened on the previous flights. We try to never have the same problem happen twice. We work very diligently to keep that from happening. Now, we have had a few occasions where this, we have had the same problem happen twice because we weren't able to sort out the cause of the problem. But we go through each problem that we have, and we close those things out before we fly the spacecraft again. So I hope that makes it safer. But each spacecraft that starts off is supposed to be in 100% shape or it doesn't go. For Dick Slayton, in earlier days, Dick, you were very careful to keep the astronauts from being exposed to questions before you could get at them with debriefing. I'm wondering if the mini debriefing we had on the air last night and the shipboard debriefing today affects your operation. I think the press conference last night was programmed. We had no problem with that at all. The one today was not programmed. I have nothing else to say about that. Emily Driscoll. I have two questions. I don't know to whom this should be addressed. I want to be sure. When we were making our descent, were we on AGS to the lunar surface? Were we relying on the abort guidance system for abort? Yes. Yes. Well, you could abort on either the primary guidance system or the AGS. They were both operational at the time we were descending. Even though you programmed around the switch? Yes. The AGS does not have the capability of guiding the spacecraft to the lunar surface. It's an abort guidance system. It's not a landing guidance system. It's an abort guidance system only. You can abort on either the primary guidance system or the abort guidance system, but you cannot land on either one of them. You have to have the primary guidance system to land unless you get very close to the lunar surface and then you can do it. Mr. Dick Slaton, and probably it would have been better asked in the previous conference. But last night on NBC, John Chancellor hinted very strongly that some words that Al Shepard had Sunday night concerning the prisoners of war in Vietnam were not Al Shepard's words, were words that he had been instructed to speak from space. Indeed, my question is this. Have any of the astronauts, especially on Apollo 14, been instructed to make any statements that might help the United States in the propaganda war? I can assure you that anything Al Shepard said on this flight were his own words. There's no question about that. Going back to the unscheduled debriefing, we got the impression, or at least I did, that this is being kept going because a call was expected from the President. Was there some failure of communications that resulted in this call not getting through? I'm not aware of any. I don't know of any. I think Ms. Driscoll had a follow on that. It wasn't a follow on that, but it was one for Dr. Berry. According to my tally, they took no medication. Is that right? That's correct, Beverly. They took no medications. None at all. Do you think it had anything to do with the pre-flight quarantine? Well, they were well, the whole flight, and whether it had something to do with the pre-flight quarantine or not, I guess is still a moot question, but we'd hope so, too. That's right. Mary Boeb. Jim, prior to liftoff from the moon, you were having some problems there. As my understanding, it was overheating both in the stirrable antenna and the radar. And if that is so, was it due to equipment problems in general, or do you think it was due to some of the solar environment that you hadn't encountered before, perhaps the sun angle or position of the spacecraft? No, the circuit breaker kept popping on the stirrable S-band antenna, and this can be caused from a number of reasons. It can be caused from a problem in the S-band antenna, or it can be caused by a lack of, I guess you could call it synchronization between the ground and the spacecraft, and we were not sure which it was. If the ground signal is jittery, it causes the antenna to start searching, and it's a characteristic of this particular antenna that if it drives into the stops and stays there for any length of time, it'll pop the circuit breaker. The circuit breaker is put in there to prevent the system from overheating, and that's what it's doing when it goes into the stops, it just can't drive any longer, so the circuit breaker comes out. We are going to have to go back and really look very closely at the ground system and at the airborne system to find out really whether it was the airborne system or the ground system that had the jitter in it. It operated normally during the ascent, and it looks to me from the data that we've looked at so far that the antenna was working properly on the spacecraft, but I really can't say that for sure. We've got to look at some more data. I don't think we had any problem with the radar. It did heat up, but that was just due to the sun shining on it, and it wasn't unexpected. The radar electronics produce heat like all the other things, and you expect those things to heat up, but it wasn't popping circuit breakers or anything. We've been out of communication since we left mission control, but I've been told that the president's call did go through. There was a delay, but it went through. That's for your question. Zach Strickler. Jim, you've had nine days now to look back over the first of the problems that developed. Are there any mysteries? Are you all fairly satisfied that you think you've got a hack on what could have gone wrong in each of the problem areas? Well, I still think the main thing, the probe problem, which I talked to you all about earlier, and I also said at the time we were not going to bring the probe back. Subsequently, I changed my mind and decided we'd better have it back. I think that the decisions that we made along the way were still correct, and I think that the problem with the probe was indeed that we had some foreign object in it that we know what happened to the bit thing. I think we have a pretty good understanding of the landing radar, although not completely. So I think as we went along, we had a pretty good understanding. We brought the probe back to make sure that we weren't going to be spending a lot of time searching for things that were not wrong with it. If you bring a good probe back and show that it's a good probe, that's almost as interesting as bringing back a bad probe and finding that it's bad. So I think that we can save ourselves a lot of time with the probe. We still think that it would work fine if we tried it another hundred times. I would like to ask Mr. Slayton, your team now is 40-odd, maybe even 50 men strong. And if I'm counting right, you need nine more Apollo astronauts, maybe nine more for Skylab A, and maybe nine more if Skylab B should ever fly. But where is the rest of the jobs coming from? I mean, you still have quite a few, maybe two dozen or so left, which might be without jobs. Yes, I think we recognized that some time ago. As a matter of fact, the last group of scientists we brought on board at the time that we actually brought them on board, we knew at that time that we had no flights for them. And they were well apprised of that at that point. Our programs had changed, the structure totally in the interim. And things haven't improved, as you're aware of. So that's correct. We do have a surplus of flight crews to our requirements for flying missions. However, we do have a great amount of work for these people to do and support a follow on programs. And they've been very helpful in doing this, primarily in Skylab.Mitchell or Shabbat mentioned that on that slope of Cone Crater, their only problem actually was they had to, they were working against the clock. Will you have a more relaxed or generous timetable on the next missions? I don't think so, no. I think we would rather have a fairly stringent timeline. We recognize that we can't simulate either 0G or 1 6G in total in our turning exercises. So we put some pad in there, but on the other hand I think it would be very bad if we ended up with five hours on a lunar surface and only programed two and a half hours work. We'd much rather have it the other way around. Nick Chris. Does that relate in any way to statements made by some of the scientists yesterday who said they thought in future flights the astronauts should have more freedom to make decisions, more time to do what they will and not such a cramp act scheduled? Do any of you have any particular feelings or comments on that? Well, I didn't of course listen to the science comments yesterday, but I think in this particular case we had another number of stops along the traverse route and some I'm sure were a little more important than others. I don't think it was all that critical in any case that we stopped at the particular crater we had marked on a map, for example. I think if we had accumulated samples in the vicinity that probably in most cases would have satisfied the requirement. And I think also if you look at the traverse and the stops we had planned that there was some redundancy built in there. So I think the fact that we did not get documented samples at each spot on the Apollo 14 traverse, at least in my opinion, and you'll have to ask the scientists for theirs, was really not all that significant. Mark, boom. Deke, I think, and specifically Paul Gast, who was saying that what the man on the moon needs to do is have time to stop and think and use his brain and not always be pressured into thinking that what's coming next on the timeline, that when he's doing a field geology problem up there that he should have time to say, hey, I think this over here looks interesting, let me do that. And he says that there just needs more pad. Do you think more pad is needed? I think you're probably right in that case. Yes, I think the field geology, especially when we get the rover and we're going to be traveling around a much bigger area, we'll be seeing things that may not necessarily be like we thought they were from the maps. I think you're probably right. You know, it's interesting to note though that the crew on Apollo 14 did have a chance to do that. They saw these white rocks and went over there and took some samples from that. So it's not like we're not doing that already. Just the fact is that we have a limited amount of time outside and a tremendous amount of work to do. You'd like to pre-plan everything the best you can based on what you know, but I think we've got the flexibility there for the crew to do what they think is best on the scene. We'll move back this way. Zach Strickland? Dick, you had a fairly unique training program for the Frommara exploration with Jim Lovell and his crew preparing for it and then of course, Al Shepard and his picking it up after 13. Was this an advantage? Was this reflected in the fact that they did accomplish a hell of a lot and they did it with a minimum of difficulty? Could you equate that with the fact that they had a stretched out training program? I'm sure that there was some element of that there, yes, because we had worked the Frommara site pretty good for 13 and there was a minimum of modification necessary for the 14 guys. So yes, in that respect, I'm sure it was beneficial. On the other hand, I don't think we have any reservations at all at the 15 crew when we fly and go to Hadley Real that they will be equally well trained to explore that site also. Would you consider your lunar mapping capability at the present one of your weaker links in properly drawing and traverse maps and preparing astronauts for what they'll encounter on the ground when they get there in Frommara? Yes, it is. Although I think our sites have been selected in areas that we do have fairly good orbit photography or manned spaceflight photography. We obviously aren't going to attempt to go someplace where we don't have reasonably good maps. In the case of 15, we are working with medium resolution instead of high resolution photography. But on the other hand, the features there are very prominent and we're not concerned at all about being able to locate that spot. Some of the details within there are defined details that won't be of the fidelity that... yes. Well, no matter how good our photography has been, unfortunately, you really don't know what's there until you get there. It's a function of the crew kind of sorting it out when you get in the area. Pete, you probably mentioned this in some change of shift briefing, but after the final docking, Mitchell, when he was back in the command module and you were debriefing him, mentioned a crack in one of the panels or something. Yeah, I think that was on the eggs. Is that normal? Well, I'm sure it isn't. I don't think it's significant. Oh, okay. He mentioned it might have happened during docking. Well, I think he was talking about a glass panel in the eggs. Was it on the eggs? Yes. I have one right here. I ask Deke Slathan and Jim McDivitt, who have contact with... when you have your contact with the American public as to the, let's call it, popularity of astronauts and so forth, do you have the feeling that you are in a... definitely in a business with sinking support or is it up and down? Can you still pick up to where you were in the beginning of the 60s or where are you in the... when it comes to having the American people behind you on going on in space? Well, I'll take a crack at it and let Jim try it, but I think we have a fair amount of support for our programs at this point. I think the big difference between now and two years ago, we had a goal which was to land on the moon. It was a significant goal that everybody could clearly understand and we'd been working on it for a total of about seven to eight years before we got there. I think there was a certain amount of national challenge involved in that particular goal. Once we've accomplished that, of course, then you get the obvious questions, well, so what else do you need to do? And I think a lot of people lost sight of the fact that the real purpose of going there was, in fact, to do science and that's what we're doing now. It's a little harder in that area to explain exactly what your return is. There again, the scientists should be talking this subject rather than me, but a lot of the samples from 11 and 12, for example, have still not been totally analyzed and I'm sure it'll be a long time before we really understand what we found on 14. In some cases, it may even be yours before something comes out of it that is of great enough significance to really attract international attention. So I think that's kind of the difference as I see it. Let me take a crack at that. I agree with the things that Deke said. I think there's one other thing that I find significant. It's difficult for me, because I'm busy doing other things, to really judge the total feeling of the American public. I can't help but feel that we still have some very strong support there. The thing that's more obvious, though, is the editorial support that we get from the news people or lack of it. It's much easier to judge how the editorials are going or how the news is being reported, because that's the kind of thing I see most. I read the newspapers and I listen to television and the radio, and I do that every day, but I don't have the opportunity to go out and talk to a large number of people who are not associated with space programs. It's much more difficult for me to get their feelings than it is for me to get yours. Along the same line for Zigg, someone told me this afternoon that on a log was written the word splash, dash, reduction in personnel. Do you think you can keep a team together for Apollo 15? Can you keep the morale up in these people who are suffering rather large budget cuts and are worried about their jobs? Can the program continue to go on and function well with these budget cuts that you're suffering? Yes, I think so unquestionably. I think people in the flight operations area are extremely highly motivated in doing what they're doing. They really like what they're doing, and I think this flight will probably help a lot in the kind of thing you're talking about. The 10 months or so that we didn't fly was probably the harder part. Thank you very much. Thank you.Thank you.",
